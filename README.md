Test Automation Repository for Robot Framework with Python
Welcome to the RobotFramework_Python Test Automation repository! This repository contains useful resources for learning Python, preparing for interviews, and practicing test automation using Robot Framework.

### Project Structure
The project is organized into three main folders:

1. Learn_Python
This folder contains detailed documentation and Python programming resources:

OOPS (Object-Oriented Programming) concepts in Python.
Python basics and advanced topics.
Hands-on practice with Python code examples.
Commonly asked Python interview questions with solutions.
Files in this folder include informative text files as well as Python script files (.py), which help demonstrate concepts.

2. Interview_prep
This folder is dedicated to interview preparation. It contains topics related to:

API Testing
CI/CD
BDD (Behavior-Driven Development)
Defect Management
SQL
SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)
STLC (Software Testing Life Cycle)
Xpath, CSS Selectors
Git
You will find many text files that explain these concepts in detail and provide useful information for interview preparation.

3. Mini_projects
In this folder, you'll find several mini-projects with real-life solutions. These projects demonstrate practical applications of Python and Robot Framework for test automation.

###  Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure that you have the following installed on your machine:

Python 3.x (Python 3.6 or higher recommended)
Robot Framework (can be installed using pip)
Git (for cloning the repository)

### Git Installation and Setup
If you don’t have Git installed, follow the instructions below:

Install Git
You can download and install Git from the official site: Git Downloads

Clone the Repository
Once Git is installed, you can clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

bash

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/robot-framework-python-automation.git
Replace yourusername with your actual GitHub username.

Navigate to the Project Directory
Change to the directory where you have cloned the repository:

bash
cd robot-framework-python-automation
Installing Dependencies
To set up the environment and install the necessary dependencies, follow these steps:

Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:

Windows:
bash
venv\Scripts\activate

Mac/Linux:
bash
source venv/bin/activate
Install the required Python dependencies:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Note: If the requirements.txt file is not provided, you can manually install the required packages for Robot Framework:

bash
pip install robotframework
Running the Tests
Once you've installed the necessary dependencies, you can run the test automation scripts using Robot Framework.

To execute a Robot Framework test case, navigate to the test directory and run:

bash
robot <test_file>.robot
Example:

bash
robot tests/my_test_suite.robot
You can also execute multiple test suites by providing the path to the directory that contains .robot files.
