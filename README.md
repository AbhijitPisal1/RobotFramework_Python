## Repository Overview

This repository is an excellent starting point for beginners who wish to learn test automation using **Robot Framework** and **Selenium** in Python. The repository also contains additional resources to help enhance your Python programming skills and prepare for job interviews.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.8+** (Required for running the repository)
- **Robot Framework** (Test automation framework)
- **Selenium** (WebDriver for browser automation)

## Installation Instructions

To get started with this repository on your local machine, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites:
1. **Python 3.8+**: Make sure you have Python 3.8 or above installed on your system.
2. **Git Bash**: You will need **Git Bash** (or any other terminal of your choice) to clone the repository.
3. **IDE**: You can use **Eclipse** or **PyCharm** to open and work with the repository.

### Steps to Clone and Set Up:

1.	**Clone the repository**:
   git clone https://github.com/AbhijitPisal1/RobotFramework_Python.git
   cd RobotFramework_Python
2.	Set up a Python virtual environment (Optional but recommended):
3.	python3 -m venv venv  # Create a virtual environment
4.	source venv/bin/activate  # Activate the virtual environment (Linux/Mac)
5.	venv\Scripts\activate  # Activate the virtual environment (Windows)
6.	Install the required dependencies:
7.	pip install -r requirements.txt
This will install all necessary packages, including Selenium, Robot Framework, and other Python dependencies.

Folder Structure
The repository is organized into several folders to help you learn and practice different aspects of Python, Test Automation, and Agile SDLC. Here’s a breakdown of the folder structure:
Learn_python:
This folder is designed to enhance your Python programming knowledge. It contains subfolders focusing on different Python concepts:
•	basics: Includes basic Python codes and programs to help you understand core Python concepts.
•	oops: Covers basic Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, using a simple Vehicles example to demonstrate all four OOP principles (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction).
•	oops_projects: Contains 3 advanced OOP projects that showcase real-life examples:
1.	Ecommerce System
2.	Library Management System
3.	Vehicle Rental System
•	python_basic_programs: A collection of commonly asked Python interview questions and their solutions.
interview_prep:
This folder is aimed at helping you prepare for job interviews with a variety of topics related to Test Automation, SDLC, and Agile methodologies. It contains several .txt files on the following topics:
•	API Testing
•	BDD (Behavior-Driven Development)
•	Behavioral Interview Questions
•	CI/CD
•	CSS
•	XPath
•	Git
•	Page Object Model (POM)
•	SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)
•	STL (Software Testing Life Cycle)
mini_projects:
This folder contains mini projects that will help you gain hands-on experience with Selenium and Robot Framework. These projects will allow you to practice various automation techniques, including BDD, Gherkin, and Keyword Driven Testing.
•	api: Example of basic API testing.
•	calendar_demo: A simple project demonstrating calendar functionality.
•	robotframework_basics: Introduction to basic concepts of Robot Framework.
•	rsproject: Robot Framework test cases for various automation tasks.
•	saucdemo: A demo project for Sauce Labs integration with Selenium.
