Repository Setup and Contribution Instructions

1. Cloning the Repository
To start working on this project, first clone the repository to your local machine.
    1. Install Git
If you don’t have Git installed on your machine, download and install it from git-scm.com.
    2. Clone the Repository
Open a terminal (Command Prompt, Git Bash, or any terminal of your choice) and navigate to the directory where you want to store the repository. Then run the following command to clone the repository:
    3. git clone https://github.com/AbhijitPisal1/RobotFramework_Python.git
    4. Navigate into the Project Directory
Once the repository is cloned, move into the project directory:
    5. cd RobotFramework_Python.git

2. Creating a New Branch for Your Work
We encourage you to create a new branch when working on a specific feature, bug fix, or research. This keeps the main branch clean and ensures easy collaboration.
    1. Create and Switch to a New Branch
To create a new branch and switch to it, use the following command:
    2. git checkout -b <new-branch-name>
Replace <new-branch-name> with a descriptive name for your branch (e.g., feature-x, bugfix-y, research-z).
    3. Verify Branch Creation
You can verify that you’re on the correct branch by running:
    4. git branch
The current branch will be highlighted with an asterisk (*).

3. Making Changes and Committing Locally
Once you’ve made changes to the code or added new features, you’ll need to commit your work to the repository.
    1. Stage Your Changes
Use git add to stage the changes. You can add specific files or all files at once:
    2. git add .
    3. Commit Your Changes
After staging your changes, commit them with a meaningful message:
    4. git commit -m "Describe your changes here"
    5. View Commit History
To view your commit history, run:
    6. git log

4. Pushing Changes to GitHub
Once your work is complete and committed locally, push your changes to the remote repository on GitHub.
    1. Push Your Branch to GitHub
To push your changes to GitHub, run the following command:
    2. git push origin <new-branch-name>
Replace <new-branch-name> with the name of your branch.
    3. Create a Pull Request (PR)
After pushing your branch, go to the GitHub repository and you should see an option to Compare & Pull Request. Click on it to create a PR and merge your changes into the main branch (or another relevant branch).

5. Forking the Repository (For External Contributors)
If you don’t have write access to the repository, you should fork the repository first and then create a pull request from your fork.
Steps to Fork and Contribute
    1. Fork the Repository
Go to the repository page on GitHub (https://github.com/xyz.git) and click on the Fork button in the upper-right corner to create a copy of the repository under your own GitHub account.
    2. Clone Your Forked Repository
Clone your forked repository to your local machine:
    3. git clone https://github.com/your-username/xyz.git
    4. Add the Original Repository as a Remote
To keep your fork updated with changes from the original repository, add the original repository as a remote:
    5. git remote add upstream https://github.com/xyz.git
    6. Sync Your Fork with the Original Repository
Periodically fetch the latest changes from the original repository and merge them into your fork:
    7. git fetch upstream
    8. git checkout main
    9. git merge upstream/main
After merging, push the changes to your fork:
git push origin main
    10. Create a Pull Request
Once you’ve made changes and committed them to your fork, go to GitHub and create a pull request (PR) from your fork to the original repository.

6. Pulling the Latest Changes
If others have made changes to the repository and you want to stay up-to-date, you can pull the latest changes into your local repository.
    1. Pull the Latest Changes
To pull the latest changes from the remote repository (usually origin), run:
    2. git pull origin main
    3. Syncing Forked Repositories
If you have forked the repository, follow these steps to sync with the original repository (as mentioned in the "Forking the Repository" section).

7. Handling Merge Conflicts
When merging changes from different branches or contributors, conflicts may arise. Git will notify you of conflicts, and you'll need to manually resolve them.
    1. Resolve Conflicts
Open the conflicting files and make the necessary changes. Conflicts will be marked with conflict markers like <<<<<<<, =======, and >>>>>>>.
    2. Mark as Resolved
After resolving conflicts, mark the files as resolved:
    3. git add <resolved-file>
    4. Commit the Merge
Commit the merge resolution:
    5. git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict"
    6. Push the Resolved Changes
Push your changes to the remote repository:
    7. git push origin <branch-name>
