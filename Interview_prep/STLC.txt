Q) Differentiate between verification and validation in STLC
Ans.)
Verification:
    - process of evaluating work products (requirements, design, code, etc.) to ensure that they meet specified requirements.
    - It answers the question, "Are we building the product right?".
    - It focuses on the processes and documentation.
    - It ensures that the product is being developed correctly according to the specifications and standards.
    - Reviewing requirements for completeness, ensuring design specifications match requirements.

Validation:
    - process of evaluating the finished product to ensure it meets the business needs and the requirements intended for the end user.
    - It answers the question, "Are we building the right product?"
    - It focuses on the final product and its functionality.
    - It checks whether the software works as intended in real-world scenarios.
    - Running tests to ensure the application behaves as expected and meets user needs.
================================================================================
Q) What is the role of a traceability matrix in STLC?
Ans.)
    - The primary role is to establish a clear relationship between requirements and the corresponding test cases.
    - Ensures that all requirements defined in the requirements documentation are covered by test cases.
    - Helps in assessing whether all the functional and non-functional requirements have been tested.
    - Provides a visual representation of which requirements have corresponding test cases and highlights any gaps in coverage.
    - Allows testers to quickly identify which test cases need to be updated or created in case of requirement changes
    - Aids in prioritizing test cases based on their associated requirements, ensuring that critical aspects are validated early in the testing process.
    - Provides a clear view of the testing scope and assists in discussions regarding testing status and progress.
    - Provides documentation that can be used for audits and reviews, demonstrating that all requirements have been tested.
================================================================================
Q) How do you prioritize test cases based on their severity and priority?
Ans.)
  1. Define Severity: Assess the impact of a defect on the application's functionality.
    Critical: Causes system failure or data loss.
    Major: Significantly affects functionality but has a workaround.
    Minor: Affects usability but does not impede functionality.
    Trivial: Cosmetic issues with minimal impact.
  2. Define Priority: Determine the urgency of fixing the defect based on business needs and timelines.
    High Priority: Needs immediate attention due to business impact.
    Medium Priority: Should be resolved soon but is not urgent.
    Low Priority: Can be addressed in future releases.
  3. Mapping Test Cases:
    Test cases linked to critical requirements or high-impact features receive higher priority.
    Consider the project deadlines and release plans; critical deficiencies may require expedited testing.
  4. Risk Assessment: Evaluate risks associated with not testing certain features thoroughly.
    High-risk areas should be prioritized.
  5. Stakeholder Input: Consult with stakeholders to align on priorities especially for business-critical applications.
================================================================================
Q) What is the difference between black-box testing and white-box testing?
Ans.)
The difference lies in the approach and knowledge of the tester regarding the internal workings of the software.
 Black-Box Testing: examines application behavior without internal insight
    @Definition: Testing without knowledge of the internal code or logic of the application.
    @Focus: Evaluates functionality based on requirements and specifications.
    @Approach: Testers provide inputs and verify outputs without any consideration of how the outputs are produced.
    @Examples: Functional testing, user acceptance testing (UAT), and system testing.
 White-Box Testing: focuses on code structure and logic
    @Definition: Testing with full knowledge of the internal code and logic of the application.
    @Focus: Tests internal structures, code paths, and logic.
    @Approach: Testers design tests based on code and implementation details to assess performance and security.
    @Examples: Unit testing, code coverage testing, and integration testing.
================================================================================
Q) Explain the concept of boundary value analysis
Ans.)
@Definition :
    -Testing technique used to identify errors at the boundaries of input value ranges rather than focusing solely in the center.
    - BVA helps ensure robust testing by focusing on potential areas of failure at the boundaries
@Process :
    1. Focus on Edge Cases: BVA tests values at the edges of input domains, as defects often occur at these boundaries.
    2. Identify Input Ranges: For any given input, determine the valid and invalid ranges.
    3. Test Cases: Create test cases using:
        - The exact boundary values (minimum and maximum).
        - Just inside the boundaries (one unit above/below).
        - Just outside the boundaries (one unit above/below).
@Example :
    If an input field accepts values from 1 to 100:
    - Valid test cases: 1 (min), 100 (max).
    - Invalid test cases: 0 (below min), 101 (above max).
    - Just inside test cases: 2 (above min), 99 (below max).
================================================================================
Q) Describe what regression testing is and when it's necessary
Ans.)
@Definition :
    - Verifies that recent code changes have not adversely affected existing functionalities i.e., software integrity is maintained
    - Ensure that previously working features continue to operate as intended after changes are made
@When It's Necessary:
    1. Code Changes: After bug fixes, feature enhancements, or updates to existing code.
    2. New Features: When new functionalities are added that may impact existing features.
    3. Environment Changes: After migrating the application to a different environment, such as a new OS, server, or database.
    4. Integration: When integrating third-party components or systems into the application.
    5. Performance Optimizations: After optimizing code for performance, to ensure that functionality remains intact.
================================================================================
Q) What are the challenges in implementing an effective STLC process?
Ans.)
    1. Inadequate Requirements: Ambiguous or incomplete requirements can lead to misunderstandings and gaps in testing.
    2. Communication Gaps: Poor communication among stakeholders (developers, testers, and product owners) can result in misalignment and missed expectations.
    3. Resource Limitations: Insufficient time, budget, or personnel can hinder the thoroughness and effectiveness of the testing process.
    4. Changing Requirements: Frequent changes in requirements can disrupt testing plans and lead to scope creep.
    5. Tool Integration: Difficulty in integrating various testing tools and technologies may affect efficiency and reporting.
    6. Lack of Skilled Personnel: Insufficient training or expertise among team members can impact the quality of testing.
    7. Test Environment Issues: Inconsistent or unstable test environments can result in unreliable test outcomes and hinder test execution.
    8. Automation Challenges: Selecting the appropriate automation tools and scripting can be complex, especially with varying technology stacks.
    9. Management Support: Lack of management buy-in or support for the testing process can undermine its importance and resources allocated.
================================================================================
Q) Explain the concept of "shift left testing" and its benefits
Ans.)
@definition :
    Shift Left Testing is a testing approach that emphasizes the need to conduct testing earlier in the software development life cycle (SDLC).
    The concept encourages integrating testing activities into every phase of development, starting from requirements gathering through design and coding, rather than waiting until the end of the cycle.
@Benefits of Shift Left Testing:
    1. Early Bug Detection: Identifying defects early reduces the cost and effort required to fix them compared to finding them later in the process.
    2. Improved Quality: Continuous testing ensures that quality is built into the product from the beginning, leading to a more robust application.
    3. Faster Time to Market: By reducing the number of defects and rework, teams can accelerate their development cycles, allowing for quicker releases.
    4. Enhanced Collaboration: Encourages collaboration among developers, testers, and business stakeholders, fostering a better understanding of requirements and expectations.
    5. Reduced Risks: Early identification of issues helps mitigate risks related to project timelines, costs, and customer satisfaction.
    6. Better Requirement Clarity: Engaging testers early often leads to clearer requirements and a more thorough understanding of the application.
================================================================================
Q) How do you integrate automated testing tools into your STLC process?
Ans.)
    1. Identify Test Cases for Automation: Select test cases that are repetitive, require extensive data, or have high risks, as these are ideal candidates for automation.
    2. Choose the Right Tools: Evaluate and select automation tools that align with the technology stack, project needs, and team expertise (e.g., Selenium, QTP, JUnit).
    3. Define Automation Strategy: Develop a clear strategy outlining the scope of automation, goals, frameworks to be used (e.g., data-driven, keyword-driven), and maintenance plans.
    4. Develop Automation Scripts: Write automated test scripts based on the selected test cases, maintaining best coding practices for readability and maintainability.
    5. Integrate with CI/CD: Incorporate the automated tests into the Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to ensure tests run automatically with each build.
    6. Execute Tests: Run automated tests regularly and analyze results to identify any failures or regressions.
    7. Maintain Test Scripts: Regularly update and maintain test scripts to ensure they remain effective and aligned with evolving requirements.
    8. Review Results: Analyze test results and report findings to stakeholders, making adjustments based on feedback for continuous improvement.
    9. Train the Team: Provide training and resources for team members to ensure they are proficient in using the automated testing tools.
================================================================================
Q) How do you address flaky tests in automation?
Ans.)
    - Identifying Root Causes: Analyze flaky tests to determine if failures are due to timing issues, environmental problems, or bugs in the application.
    - Implicit and Explicit Waits: Use appropriate wait strategies to handle timing issues in web applications, ensuring elements are fully loaded before interactions.
    - Stabilizing Tests: Refactor tests to create a more stable testing environment, including isolating tests to avoid dependency on the state of the application.
    - Test Data Management: Ensure that the test data is consistent and reliably set up prior to test execution.
    Regular Review: Continuously monitor and review flaky tests and prioritize them for investigation and fixes.

8) RTM - with Forward-Backward-Bi-directional Traceability
Q) Explain what is smoke testing and Sanity Testing ?
Ans.)
Smoke Testing:
  @ Definition:
    - A preliminary testing phase that assesses the basic and critical functionalities of an application to verify its stability for further testing.
    - Conducted after a new build is created
    - It functions as a "build verification test" to ensure that major functions work correctly before deeper tests are performed.
    - Quickly evaluate the application's health.
    - Identify major issues early, preventing wasted time on unstable builds.
    - Optimize testing efficiency by filtering out problematic builds.

Sanity Testing:
  Definition:
    - A Quick and focused type of testing used to verify specific functionalities or bug fixes in a software build, ensuring they work as intended.
    - Conducted following minor changes or bug fixes.
    - It's a narrow-scope evaluation performed after changes are made to ensure it did not introduce new issues
    - Confirm that particular areas of the application are stable before proceeding with broader testing (such as regression testing).

@ Differences Between Smoke and Sanity Testing:
  Scope:     Smoke testing covers a broader aspect of the application’s functionalities, while sanity testing focuses on specific areas.
  Timing:    Smoke testing is performed on new builds to assess overall stability; sanity testing is conducted after changes or fixes to verify targeted functionalities.
  Purpose:  Smoke testing aims to ensure the application is ready for further testing, while sanity testing ensures the stability of recent changes before larger-scale testing is executed.
================================================================================
Q ) Define and Explain below testing methodologies.

1. Adhoc Testing:
    - A form of informal testing without any formal test plan or documentation.
    - Testers explore the application randomly to find defects.

2. Monkey Testing:
    - A type of random testing where the tester inputs arbitrary or random data into the application without any knowledge of the application's functionality.
    - The aim is to find unexpected issues.

3. Gorilla Testing:
    - An intense or focused form of testing of a specific functionality or feature, usually after it has undergone changes, to ensure that it performs as expected under various scenarios.

4. Exploratory Testing:
    - A hands-on approach to testing where testers explore the software, learn about its features, and design their tests on the fly.
    - It combines test design and execution into one process, often relying on testers’ intuition and experience.

5. Dynamic Testing:
    - Testing conducted by executing the code.
    - It involves running the application with various inputs and examining the outputs as well as the internal behavior.

6. Static Testing:
    - Testing that involves reviewing and analyzing the code, requirements, and design documents without executing the software.
    - Techniques include code reviews, inspections, and static analysis.

7. Interface Testing (Client-Server-Database):
    - Testing interactions between different components or layers of an application, such as the user interface (client), the application logic (server), and the database.
    - This ensures data exchange between these layers occurs correctly.

9. Error Guessing:
    - A technique where testers use their intuition and experience to anticipate where errors might occur and design test cases to try and expose those errors.

10. Boundary Value Analysis:
    - A testing technique that focuses on values at the boundaries (minimum and maximum) of equivalence partitions to ensure the system behaves correctly at these edge cases.

11. Equivalence Class Partitioning:
    - A technique that divides input data into equivalent partitions where test cases can be derived from each partition, reducing the total number of test cases while maintaining test coverage.

12. Risk Mitigation:
    - The process of identifying, assessing, and prioritizing risks followed by the application of resources to minimize, control, or eliminate the likelihood and impact of those risks on the project.

13. Authentication:
    - The process of verifying the identity of a user or system, typically involving credentials such as usernames and passwords.

14. Authorization:
    -The process of granting or denying access rights to a user based on their identity and permissions allocated to them.

15. Test Closure Report:
    - A document that summarizes the testing activities, results, and overall quality of the application at the end of the testing life cycle.
    - It typically includes metrics, defect status, and lessons learned.

16. Error Seeding:
    A technique where known defects are deliberately inserted into the software to measure the effectiveness of the testing process and the testers' ability to identify and fix these defects.

17. Showstopper Defect - Suspension Criteria:
    - A severe defect that halts the testing process because it prevents further testing from being carried out. Such defects must be resolved before testing can resume.

18. A/B Testing:
    - A method of comparing two versions of a web page, application, or feature to determine which one performs better in terms of specific metrics (e.g., conversion rates).

19. Concurrency Testing:
    - Testing that verifies the system's ability to handle multiple transactions or processes simultaneously without performance degradation or failures. It checks for issues like deadlock, race conditions, or resource contention.

20. Priority:
    - Refers to the importance of fixing a defect based on the business impact or urgency. It determines how soon a defect should be addressed.

21. Severity:
    - Refers to the level of impact a defect has on the application’s functionality. It indicates how serious the defect is and its effect on the system (e.g., critical, major, minor).

22. Integration Testing:
    - Integration testing is a software testing phase where individual modules or components of an application are combined and tested as a group.
    - The primary goal is to identify interface defects and ensure that the integrated components work together correctly.

23. Incremental Testing:
    - An approach to integration testing where components are integrated and tested in small increments, rather than all at once.
    - This method allows for early detection of defects and makes it easier to isolate issues as each set of components is tested after integration.

24. Top-Down Testing:
    - Testing starts with higher-level modules and works downward, using stubs for lower-level modules.
    - It allows early design flaw detection but may involve time-consuming stub development.

25. Bottom-Up Testing:
    -Testing starts with lower-level modules and works upward, using drivers for upper-level modules.
    - It encourages robust lower-level designs but may delay detection of upper-level integration issues.

26. Non-Incremental Testing/ Big Bang Testing:
    - All components are integrated at once after development and tested collectively.
    - This method can complicate defect isolation, as issues may arise from interactions between multiple components.

27. UAT and handoff given to teams.
    - The final phase of the software testing process, where actual users validate the system's functionality and performance against the business requirements.
    - It is conducted in a real-world environment to ensure that the software meets the needs and expectations of its end users before it is released into production.
  @Handoffs in UAT
        Development to UAT: Transfer application and documentation.
        UAT to Development: Report defects for resolution.
        UAT to Operations: Handoff for production deployment, including documentation and support materials.
================================================================================
Q) What are the different reports in testing?
Ans.)
Test Summary Report: Provides an overview of testing activities, outcomes, and metrics, summarizing the testing process.
Bug Report: Documents defects found during testing, including details like severity, steps to reproduce, and status.
Test Case Report: Lists the test cases executed, their results (pass/fail), and any comments regarding their execution.
Defect Density Report: Measures the number of defects identified relative to the size of the software, typically expressed per unit of measure (e.g., per KLOC).
Execution Report: Details the status of test execution, indicating which test cases were executed, passed, failed, or skipped.
Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM): Ensures that all requirements are covered by test cases, linking requirements to their corresponding tests.
Test Coverage Report: Measures the extent to which the application has been tested, indicating which parts of the application have been covered by test cases.
