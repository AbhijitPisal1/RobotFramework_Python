3. Question: How do you manage database configurations in Robot Framework?

Answer: I store database connection parameters (like host, user, password) in a configuration file or environment variables. This allows for easy modifications and maintains security by avoiding hardcoding sensitive information.

4. Question: Can you explain how to handle multiple database queries in a single test?

Answer: I can execute multiple SQL queries sequentially within the same Robot Framework test case using the Database Library. Each query can be executed with separate keywords, ensuring that results from one query can be used in subsequent ones.

5. Question: How do you rollback changes after running tests that modify the database?

Answer: I use transactions around my $INSERT$, $UPDATE$, and $DELETE$ operations. By starting a transaction at the beginning of the test and rolling it back at the end, I can maintain database integrity without persisting test data changes.

6. Question: How do you verify the impact of a change in your application on the database?

Answer: I compare database states before and after the change using SQL queries to gather relevant data. By asserting that the changes align with expectations, I validate the application's effect on the database.

7. Question: What methods do you use to parameterize SQL queries in your tests?

Answer: I use Robot Framework's variable substitution feature to parameterize SQL queries. This allows me to pass dynamic values during query execution, improving the flexibility and reusability of my test cases.

8. Question: How do you validate referential integrity in your database tests?

Answer: Referential integrity is validated by checking foreign key constraints using $SELECT$ statements to ensure that all foreign keys reference valid primary key entries. I verify that expected relationships exist and report any discrepancies.

9. Question: How do you handle exceptions or data inconsistencies during your database tests?

Answer: I implement error handling within my test cases using Robot Framework's built-in keywords to capture and log errors. This ensures that if an inconsistency is found, detailed information is available for troubleshooting.

10. Question: What strategies do you use to ensure the database schema is tested across different environments?

Answer: I maintain environment-specific configuration files for database connections and use automated migration tools to ensure schema consistency across environments. This way, my tests run accurately regardless of the database environment.

11. Question: How do you approach writing tests for complex SQL queries?

Answer: For complex SQL queries, I break down the query into smaller, more manageable parts. I test each part individually for correctness before integrating them into a comprehensive test case in Robot Framework.

12. Question: Can you describe how to use SQL joins in your test data validation?

Answer: I perform $JOIN$ operations in my SQL queries to combine data from multiple tables. This allows me to validate relationships and ensure that the integrated data aligns with application logic during tests.

13. Question: How do you ensure that database tests are stable and repeatable?

Answer: I maintain consistent test environments by using fixed datasets, ensuring transaction rollbacks after tests, and utilizing version control for SQL scripts. These practices create a stable context for each test execution.

14. Question: What are some security aspects you consider while testing databases?

Answer: I focus on validating user permissions, ensuring proper authentication, testing for SQL injection vulnerabilities, and verifying that sensitive data is handled according to security standards.

2. Question: Can you explain the difference between $GROUP BY$ and $ORDER BY$ clauses?

Answer: The $GROUP BY$ clause is used to aggregate data based on one or more columns, often in conjunction with aggregate functions like $SUM$ or $COUNT$. The $ORDER BY$ clause organizes the result set in a specified order (ascending or descending) based on one or more columns.

3. Question: What are aggregate functions in SQL? Can you name a few?

Answer: Aggregate functions perform calculations on multiple values and return a single value. Common aggregate functions include $COUNT$, $SUM$, $AVG$, $MIN$, and $MAX$. These are used to summarize data in queries.

4. Question: What is the significance of the $LIMIT$ clause in a SQL query?

Answer: The $LIMIT$ clause restricts the number of records returned by a query. It is useful for pagination and performance optimization, especially when dealing with large datasets.

5. Question: Describe the use of the $JOIN$ keyword in SQL and its importance.

Answer: The $JOIN$ keyword combines rows from two or more tables based on a related column. It's vital for querying related data across multiple tables, enabling complex data retrieval from relational databases.

6. Question: What is the purpose of the $DISTINCT$ keyword in SQL?

Answer: The $DISTINCT$ keyword is used to eliminate duplicate rows from the result set, ensuring that each returned row is unique based on the specified columns.

7. Question: Can you explain what a subquery is and where it can be used?

Answer: A subquery is a query embedded within another SQL query. It can be used in $SELECT$, $INSERT$, $UPDATE$, or $DELETE$ statements to filter or manipulate data based on another query's result, allowing for more complex data operations.

8. Question: What are indexes in SQL, and how do they improve performance?

Answer: Indexes are special data structures that improve the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table. They work similarly to book indexes, allowing the database to find data faster without scanning the entire table.

9. Question: What is the difference between $CHAR$ and $VARCHAR$ data types?

Answer: The $CHAR$ data type is fixed-length, meaning it always occupies the same amount of space regardless of the string length, while $VARCHAR$ is variable-length and only uses as much space as the actual content, making $VARCHAR$ more storage-efficient.

10. Question: How do you ensure data integrity in SQL?

Answer: Data integrity is maintained through the use of primary and foreign keys, constraints (like $NOT NULL$, $UNIQUE$), and transactions (to ensure ACID properties). These mechanisms help prevent invalid data entry and ensure consistency.

11. Question: What are SQL constraints, and can you name a few?

Answer: SQL constraints are rules that enforce data integrity within tables. Common types include $PRIMARY KEY$, $FOREIGN KEY$, $UNIQUE$, $CHECK$, and $NOT NULL$, each serving to maintain specific data requirements.

12. Question: Can you describe the concept of normalization in SQL databases?

Answer: Normalization is the process of structuring a database to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity. It involves dividing large tables into smaller, interconnected tables, following various normal forms (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, etc.).

13. Question: What is the purpose of using aliases in SQL queries?

Answer: Aliases are temporary names given to tables or columns in SQL queries. They improve readability and make complex queries easier to understand. Aliases can be defined using the $AS$ keyword.

14. Question: Why is it important to use parameterized queries?

Answer: Parameterized queries help prevent SQL injection attacks by separating SQL code from user input. They allow the database engine to safely process user inputs, enhancing security and performance.

15. Question: What are the differences between $INNER JOIN$, $LEFT JOIN$, and $RIGHT JOIN$?

Answer: An $INNER JOIN$ returns rows with matching values in both tables, while a $LEFT JOIN$ returns all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right, filling with nulls if there are no matches. Similarly, a $RIGHT JOIN$ returns all rows from the right table and matching rows from the left.

These questions aim to assess a candidate's understanding of SQL basics, including query formatting, nomenclature, and best practices.
